------

* calc1.py: Demonstrates how to define two integer variables, and
  calculate the total sum. Shows the output differences between 
  Python 2.x, and 3.x, too.

* calc2.py: Demonstrates how to sum a list of integer variables.

* calc3.py: Demonstrates how to sum a list of integer variables using
  the built-in function sum().

  For a list of built-in functions in Python 3.4 see:
  https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html

* sum-numpy.py: Demonstrates how to sum a list of integer variables
  using the sum method from the NumPy module. Also shows how to create 
  a cumulative sum.

* average.py: calculates the average for a list of values. Shows the
  output differences between Python 2.x, and 3.x, too.

* average-numpy.py: calculates the average for a list of values using
  the NumPy module. Shows the output differences between Python 2.x, 
  and 3.x, too.

* min-max.py: figure out the minimum, and the maximum value from a list
  of values.
