README
------

Demonstrates how to use an external C module using the Simplified
Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG). This requires the Swig package
to be installed (http://www.swig.org/).

To build the according shared object file, simply run 

./build_module.sh

first. Then, call

python example.py

to use the shared object file that we have created before.

The archive/directory contains the following files:

* deepthought.h:        c header file for extension module
* deepthought.c:        c extension module
* deepthought.i:        interface description for c extension module
* deepthought_setup.py: build module as shared object (SO) file
* build_module.sh:      shell script to simplify building the SO file
* example.py:           python example file that imports the module
